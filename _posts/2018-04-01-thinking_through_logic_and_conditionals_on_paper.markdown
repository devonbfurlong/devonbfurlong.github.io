I was moving through the Intro to Ruby segments pretty quickly, until I hit the segment on Logic and Conditionals. I am enjoying thinking about the if then statements and booleans, but to do more complex actions and complete the Tic Tac Toe Boards, I realized I needed to start writing out my thoughts on paper as sort of a rough draft while also working in the IDE. This is something that I wish I realized earlier on as a way to learn, in additon to working through the problems in the IDE. It has helped me to draw up the code and problem solve when I've gotten stuck after reviewing the errors. It may seem archaic to do this, but it helps me to draw the code before entering it into the IDE.
