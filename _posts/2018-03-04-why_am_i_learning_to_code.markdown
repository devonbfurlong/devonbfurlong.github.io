I work full time in retail and fashion, and it has been wild to see how technology is changing the industry. I started my career as a product category manager creating lines with design and production partners, and now I am working in ecommerce for a large retailer. I am learning to code, because I see how valuable the technology that I use on a day to day basis is, from the data that we pull to analyze selling results and customer behavior to the technical platform that our site is on and it's abaility to perform. The future of retail is online, and to continue to  be relevant in the marketplace, it is important to understand the tools that enable you to interact with your customer. There is opportunity to optimize web development to create incredibly engaging and positive customer experiences within the retail industry.
